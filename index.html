        <h1> Introduction</h1>
        </header>
      <p>C plus plus in short cpp or c++ is one of the dominante programming languge in the computer science fields.Its application is not limited for computer program rather it has tremidious application in Embedded system applications to program smaller and constrained hardwares. It's easy to learn,widely used for parallel programming to fasten the computational efficency. </p>
      
      <p> Currently, due to the increase in interest for data manipulation and machine learning,most people inclined their interest to master cpp. AI and machine learning are changing the dynamics of the world more specifically the programming world.It is not possible to master either AI or Machine Learning without having deep understanding about Cpp.

        <h1> Array Manipulation</h1>
       </header>
    <p> Array can defined as a container that store the same data types. data type can be an int, float, string, char and so on. Within an array it is not allowed to store different data types. before trying to store data, we need to reserve a memory which is equvalent to the data going to stored. If the memory reserved is less than the required amout of memory, then some of the data could be discarder, as a result, the information distoreted that would let us to commite mistake  in our analysis. Whereas, if we reserved more space than required, it is also waste of memory. Our system try to use the required amout of memory and the remaining space remain free but the operating system must wait untill the process finished and free the memory.In between, the free memory is a waste.</p>

      <header>
        <h1> Introduction to Loops</h1>
        </header>
      <p>As discussed above, Once the memory is reserved for the data, then either we need to store or retrive the data form the array. Inorder to do such array manipulation we need to use loops. There are different types of loops with their specific functionalities.</p>
  <p> To list some of them:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>For loop:- the syntax for such type of loop is <br><code class="codes"> for  (statement_1;  statement_2; <>statement_3)
         {<br>task to be performed;<br>}
         </code>
       </li> 
         <li>While loop:- the syntax for such type of loop is <br><code class="codes"> while(condition meet)
          {<br>performed task;<br>}
           </code>
       </li>
        <li>do_while loop:- the syntax for such type of loop is <br><code class="codes"> do{ 
          performed task
          <u> }while (condition meet);</u></code><br>
       </li>
  </ul>
  
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="For_Loop" >
      <header >
        <h1> For Loop</h1>
        </header>
    <p>In a for loop we must first declare the initial condition to start the loop for example, <code class="codes"> int i=0;</code> in this expresion, variable i with int data type is decleared and assigned its initial value to 0. the second parameter for the for loop is the loop control part. As discribed above, for example int n=20; and for the loop controling ,if we set it as <code class="codes"> {i less than n};</code> then the loop iterates and perform the task which is defined inside the brace as far as the condition is satisfied.</p>
    <p> The general syntax for such loop type is as follow:</p>
    <code class="codes"> for (statement_1; statement_2; statement_3)</code><br>
         {
    <br>task to be performed;
    <br>
    }
    <p>Where:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>statement_1:-is excuted one time before the program get in to the task to be performed.</li>
         <li>statment_2:-it defines the condition excute the task to be performed.</li>
           <li>statment_3:-excuted every time after the task excuted. 
    </ul>
  </section>
 <section class="main-section" id="While_Loop">
      <header >
        <h1> While Loop</h1>
        </header>
   <p>For a while loop, while the condition satisfied the program inter in to the task. For every iteration the program checks the condition then once the condition meets it perform the task and check again the condition for next excution. The loop termination terminated when the program does not able to satisfiy the while loop condition set by the programmer.</p>
  </section>
   <section class="main-section" id="Do_While_Loop">
      <header>
        <h1>Do While Loop</h1>
        </header>
     <p> The main difference between the while loop and do while loop,for the later one the program excute once without checking the condition. then after it tries to check the condition set by the programmer.If it satisfiy the condtion then the program goes to the next task excution but if it fails to satisfiy the condition, it will automatically stop the excution.
